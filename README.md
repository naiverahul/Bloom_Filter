Bloom Filter Algorithm
A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set. It can yield false positives but never false negatives. This means that it may incorrectly indicate that an element is in the set when it is not, but it will never fail to indicate that an element is in the set when it actually is.  
Probabilistic Mathematics
The Bloom filter uses multiple hash functions to map elements to positions in a bit array. The probability of false positives is determined by the size of the bit array, the number of hash functions, and the number of elements added to the filter.  
False Positive Probability
The false positive probability ( P ) can be approximated using the following formula:  [ P \approx \left(1 - e^{-\frac{kn}{m}}\right)^k ]  Where:  
( n ) is the number of elements added to the Bloom filter.
( m ) is the size of the bit array.
( k ) is the number of hash functions.
Optimal Number of Hash Functions
The optimal number of hash functions ( k ) that minimizes the false positive probability is given by:  [ k = \left(\frac{m}{n}\right) \ln(2) ]  
Size of the Bit Array
The size of the bit array ( m ) can be calculated based on the desired false positive probability ( P ) and the number of elements ( n ):  [ m = -\frac{n \ln(P)}{(\ln(2))^2} ]  
Example
For a Bloom filter with a false positive probability of 0.05 and 1000 elements, the size of the bit array and the number of hash functions can be calculated as follows:  
Calculate the size of the bit array ( m ):
[ m = -\frac{1000 \ln(0.05)}{(\ln(2))^2} \approx 6235 ]  
Calculate the optimal number of hash functions ( k ):
[ k = \left(\frac{6235}{1000}\right) \ln(2) \approx 4 ]
